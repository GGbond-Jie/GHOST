## Usage
i.   First, configure the environment according to the requirement.txt file

Ensure that the following libraries have aligned versions:

- causal-conv1d==1.1.0
- mamba-ssm==1.1.1
- torch==2.1.1+cu118
- torchvision==0.16.1+cu118
- torchaudio==0.16.1+cu118

ii. Download stock data to ```.\dataset\stock_data```  

market sentiment data to ```.\dataset```

iii. Finally, ```python run.py``` .

Don't forget to modify the number of input stocks and the number of features


## Dataset


We provide stock data from two markets: ```CSI300``` and ```NASDAQ100```. After data preprocessing, 189 and 64 stocks remain respectively, along with corresponding market sentiment data: ```CHN_NEWS_sentiment.csv``` and ```USA_NEWS_sentiment.csv```.
